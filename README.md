  - A custom **Calendar Table** was created to enable time series analysis and various time-based functions.

- **DAX Queries & Calculations**:
  - Multiple measures were created using DAX, enabling powerful insights such as **total sales**, **average price**, and **cars sold**.

- **Data Modeling**:
  - Connected the Calendar Table to the main data file with a **1-to-many relationship**.

- **Interactive Dashboard**:
  - **KPIs** at the top to display key metrics like total sales and average price.
  - **Weekly trends** and **regional sales analysis** are displayed for in-depth understanding.
  - A **map and matrix** to visualize regional distribution.
  - Added a cool **navigation button** to switch between an overview dashboard and a more detailed sheet.
